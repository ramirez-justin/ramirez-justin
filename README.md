<!--
**ramirez-justin/ramirez-justin** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my bachelors in Computer Science @ Georgia State University
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more things than I can fit in my brain; mostly Java, Python, C and bash
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source projects I can contribute towards and learn something
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning as much as I can
